# 🕵️‍♀️ Digital Forensics Multi-Tool Lab Portfolio

## 🔍 Overview

This repository presents the results of multiple digital forensics labs performed as part of my graduate coursework at Boston University (CS693 – Digital Forensics). The labs involved recovering, analyzing, and reporting on digital evidence using industry-standard tools such as **Autopsy**, **OSForensics**, and **FTK Imager**.

The objectives included:
- Recovering deleted emails, images, and documents
- Analyzing cell phone images and cloud backups
- Correlating digital artifacts across multiple devices and platforms
- Writing formal forensic reports
